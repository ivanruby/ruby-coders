The RubyCoders is an informal group that holds weekly meetings where we take an online, collaborative, and hands-on approach to learning computer programming and electronics using the Arduino platform.

We meet on Zoom and use an online simulator, [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits), to increase the accessibility of our activities. Every Thursday, between 4 and 6PM, we work on real-world projects and troubleshooting challenges designed to stimulate the group into learning together and comprehensively.

Topics: Microcontrollers, Arduino, Electronics, Computer programming, Problem-solving, Autonomous learning 

## Requirements

The only real requirement to participate is that you have access to a device with an internet connection. We are a very diverse group, with participants with different levels of expertise and are not focus

## Approach

We take a Project-Based Learning pedagogical approach in which learners work on a structured sequence of tasks that require or employ problem-solving skills while learning about and eliciting computational concepts. 

We prioritize:
- Learning together and from each other over being taught
- Exploring and understanding over memorizing
