We take a Project-Based Learning pedagogical approach in which learners work on a structured sequence of tasks that require or employ problem-solving skills while learning about and eliciting computational concepts. 

We prioritize:
- **Learning together and from each other** over being taught
- **Exploring and developing an understanding** over memorizing
- **Experiencing problems as learning opportunities** over resisting problems and troubleshooting opportunities

> While we generally work together on activities, there is no restriction on working individually. The activities are designed in such a way that it is equally possible to work on them individually and in groups.
