In this project, we will attempt to reconstruct the behavior of street lights.
An LED should turn ON or OFF based on the intensity of ambient light. To do so, 
we will use a light sensor, also called photoresistor
```

## States

- Ambient light intensity less than 1/2 max: LED OFF
- Ambient light intensity equal or more than 1/2 max: LED ON
