In this project, we will attempt to reproduce the behavior of street lights.
Remember that street lights turn ON when it starts becoming dark, i.e., when 
the light in the environment drops below a certain intensity.
When the intensity goes above this point (when it becomes brighter) the lights
are turned OFF, automatically.

In our project, we'll use a LED and it should automatically turn ON or OFF based
on the intensity of ambient light. To do so, we will use a light sensor,
also called photoresistor
```

## States

- Ambient light intensity less than 1/2 max: LED OFF
- Ambient light intensity equal or more than 1/2 max: LED ON
