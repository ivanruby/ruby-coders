The only requirements to participate is that you have access to a device with an internet connection and are available during the times we meet. We are a very diverse group, with participants with different levels of expertise and are not focused on demonstrating knowledge and skills but on learning together.

As we use the Tinkercad circuits platform as a simulator, you'll also need to have a free, personal account.

You can create one by <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/join" target="_blank">following this link</a>.
