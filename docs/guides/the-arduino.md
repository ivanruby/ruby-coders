The Arduino is a popular <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3641/microcontroller" target="_blank">microcontroller</a> used in a variety of projects. It behaves as a small computer and can perform tasks such as read data from sensors, perform operations and decisions based on this data and send data to other devices.

It includes a set of pins that can be used to connect to other compoents. These can be classified into programmable and non-programmable.

## Non-programmable pins
The most used non-programmable pins are those that we will use to give power (voltage) to our circuits. These pins will be positive (3.3 Volts or 5 Volts) and negative (Ground).

## Programmable pins
Whenever we want to assign specific behaviors to components we'll use in our circuits, we'll use programmable pins. Those are the ones we will be able to control using our program. In the Arduino board, they are divided into Analog (A0 to A5) and Digital (0 to 13) pins.
