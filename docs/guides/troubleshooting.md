Troubleshooting, the process of identifying a problem, planning and applying a solution to it can be done as to follow the phases we create for the projects (wiring, configuration and logic).

Here are sample strategies and situations:

## Wiring
- Check if the component is wired. If not, wire it
    
    **Example:** *Forgetting to connect one terminal of a resistor, a LED, a button*
<br/>

- Check if all components in the circuit are wired. If not, wire them
        
    **Example:** *Same as the previous example*

- Check if the wiring is correct for the component. If not, wire it correctly

    **Example:** *Reversing the wiring on a LED by connecting the positive terminal to a Ground (GND) pin*

- Check if the component is powered appropriately. If not, power it appropriately

     **Example:** *Wiring a component with 3.3 Volts when it requires 5 Volts* 
    
## Configuration
- Check if you created a variable for the pin that is connected to the component
- Check if you configured the pin with the appropriate mode
- Check if you initialized the component, if it needs so

## Logic
- Check if you created a variable for the pin that is connected to the component
- Check if you configured the pin with the appropriate mode
- Check if you initialized the component, if it needs so
