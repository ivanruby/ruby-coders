At the beginning of our activities, we have a description of the project. As much as possible, the projects we work on are designed to integrate real-world scenarios. However, before getting there, we also need to develop an understanding of how the different components we can use work. 

In those cases, the projects we work on might seem less representative of a real-world scenario but essential to understand how things work.


## Prompt
As an example, let's consider the following description:

```text
In this project, an LED should turn on (light up) when a button is pressed.
Both components are connected to an Arduino microcontroller.
```
> **Note:** Did the description sound challenging or include concepts foreign to you? Don't worry. We take a step-by-step approach and work on exploring concepts because we **need** them, rather than simply memorizing 

## Current state of the project
There will also be an accompanying image of the current circuit as a starting point.
