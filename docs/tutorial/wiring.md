**Task**:  Complete and troubleshoot the assembly of the circuit.

You will do so by clicking on a link to a Tinkercad project and completing the activity there.
Here is a sample wiring task: <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kaUtjdDe9jp" target="_blank">Using an LED with a Button - Part 1 - Wiring</a>

**Focus**: `Electronics`

**What we learn**: About different circuit components and how they are physically connected

**Sample solution**: *Completing the circuit that connects an Arduino microcontroller, an LED and a button*

> Notice how the LED is connected through a wire between GND (Ground) and pin 2 on the Arduino. Similarly, the button is connected between the pins GND (Ground) and 3

Each subsequent phase, **always** includes a solution of the tasks from the previous. That is, the *Calibration* phase includes a solution for the tasks in *Wiring*. Similarly, the *Logic* phase includes a solution for the tasks in *Calibration*.
