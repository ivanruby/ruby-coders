```text
In this project, we will create a game. The player has to choose a
color (Red or Green) and then press the button. At that point the 
circuit should randomly turn one of the LEDs ON. If the LED that 
turned ON matches the color picked, the player won.  
```

## States
- Player picks a color (Red or Green) - This happens before interacting with the circuit
- Button not pressed: Both LEDs OFF
- Button pressed: One of the LEDs randomly ON for 5secs
