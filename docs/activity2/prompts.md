```text
In this project, we will monitor the ambient temperature using a
temperature sensor and indicate the value using LEDs of different colors. 
Each LED will represent a temperature interval.    
```

## States
LEDs **only ON** for:
- Blue   : Temperature below 0C
- Green  : Temperature between 0C and 15C
- Yellow : Temperature between 15C and 30C
- Red	 : Temperature above 30C
